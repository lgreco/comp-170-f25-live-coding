    "# Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "For all its importance, pseudocode lacks a formal definition. Wikipedia has an [unattribute definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode#cite_ref-2) that works for me:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pseudocode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do, expressed in a formally-styled natural language*\n",
    "\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, let's write some pseudocode that prints the outline of 4x4 square using asterisks. The desired output is\n",
    "```\n",
    "****\n",
    "*  *\n",
    "*  *\n",
    "****\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you notice about the outline above is that it does not look very squarish. That's because in most fonts -- even monospace ones -- characters are not perfect squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "A monospace font guarantees that every character cell has the same width. But that doesnâ€™t mean width = height. Typically, the width of a character cell is smaller than its height. Many coding fonts have an aspect ratio of about 1:2 (they are twice as tall.) This makes each character look taller and narrower than a square. This matters because text rendering is optimized for readability, not geometric exactness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typography aside, let's assume that a 4x4 arrangement of characters *is* square-ish enough for our examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode, for this problem, is the step-by-step instructions you'll give to someone to print the square. These instructions need to be simple and precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "& \\textbf{print} (4\\times 4)\\ \\textbf{square}: \\\\\n",
    "& \\qquad \\text{print the first line with 4 }\\texttt{'*'} \\\\\n",
    "& \\qquad \\text{print 2 lines starting with an }\\texttt{'*'}, \\text{followed} \\\\\n",
    "& \\qquad\\quad \\text{by 2 spaces, followed by another }\\texttt{'*'} \\\\\n",
    "& \\qquad \\text{print the last line with 4 }\\texttt{'*'}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The pseudocode is *so impressive* that your professor is now asking you to write instructions for a 10-by-10 square. And so you oblige:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "& \\textbf{print} (10\\times 10)\\ \\textbf{square}: \\\\\n",
    "& \\qquad \\text{print the first line with 10 }\\texttt{'*'} \\\\\n",

    "& \\qquad \\text{print the last line with 10 }\\texttt{'*'}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "But when your professor asks you to write more pseudocode, let's say for a 17-by-17 square, you begin to notice patterns: first, the professor is weird. Second, you don't need to write the same pseudocode, just with different numbers. Instead, you need a *parameterized* pseudocode.\n",
    "\n",

    "& \\textbf{print} ({\\color{magenta}n}\\times {\\color{magenta}n})\\ \\textbf{square}: \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "But the professor is sneaky, and they ask you to write pseudocode for a 10x20 *rectangle*. \n",
    "Now you are onto them, and you remember from high school that a square is just a special kind of rectangle, and so you modify your existing pseucode, just a bit:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",

    "\n",
    "Your professor is contemplating one final challenge. But at this point you got this parameterization all figured out, and you suggest the pseudocode. You anticipated correctly: instead of a space character, the professor was planning to ask you to fill the middle of the shape with some other symbol!\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
